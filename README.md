# The project
Make Mail Day is a Shiny Web app designed to propose interesting services to Uni Mail students on a daily basis. The voting feature "Make our Day" enables the user of the app to contribute : a contribution means a vote of a certain area of the library. By voting, he gives information to all the other users of the app about the curent situation at the library and also contibute to make a "historical data plot", which also gives a realistic view based on the past. The access to the ranking of the best section should be able to help students find their perfect spot to study. 


## The idea
As students are generally engaged in a sort of routine, we thougt it would be interesting to collect data and understand how they behave everyday. This project was the perfect opportunity to understand how data gathering and summerizing works and to make realevant statistics about our daily working environment seemed to a very exciting. With the raise of the streaming data and the need for analysis tools to manage these data, we were curious discover the functioning of a sector of activity that has an undeniable influence on all kind of businesses nowadays.
